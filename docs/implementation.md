# Implementation Status

> **Audience: AI agents (and humans) working on this repo.**
> This is the source of truth for _where we are_ and _what's next_.
> Keep it accurate: update the status tables when you finish a unit of work.
> Routed from [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

_Last updated: 2026-06-06 (`think` — cited answer kit + offline gap analysis)_

> **Latest change.** The vault now has a **`think`** brain layer: "search gives
> raw pages, the brain gives the answer." `GET /api/think` (and the 20th MCP tool,
> `think`) runs **hybrid retrieval** (fuse lexical + semantic by RRF so neither
> exact-keyword nor conceptual matches are missed), assembles a token-budgeted
> context bundle from the fused passages, and returns a **grounded answer kit**:
> numbered **citations** (`[1]`, `[2]`…) mapped to each source passage (path +
> heading + `^block` anchor when present), the passages themselves, and a
> deterministic, **offline gap analysis** — `weakCoverage` (the best match score
> fell below a threshold, or nothing matched) plus `uncoveredTerms` ("what the
> vault doesn't yet cover"), computed from retrieval scores + stem-aware term
> coverage with **no model**. The kit-shaping is a pure, dependency-free helper in
> `@repo/shared` (`think.ts` — `assembleAnswerKit`, `AnswerKit`). The endpoint
> stays **fully offline by default**: the agent calling the MCP tool is itself the
> LLM and composes the final cited answer from the kit. Only when an OpenRouter
> key is configured **server-side** (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, mirroring the web
> app's wiring) *and* the request opts in (`?synthesize=1`) does it also include a
> synthesized prose `answer` that cites the numbered sources — and a synthesis
> failure never fails the offline kit. Covered by `apps/api` `__tests__/think.test.ts`
> (pure: multi-citation mapping, weak-coverage flag, stem-aware uncovered-term
> detection, empty corpus) and `routes/think.test.ts` (endpoint: 422 on empty
> `q`, grounded citations, gap reporting, focus-note neighbors, offline gate); the
> fresh-clone + smoke MCP tests now assert the 20-tool surface and exercise
> `think`. This is the second gbrain-inspired enhancement (item #16; see _Next up_).

> **Latest change.** Retrieval is now **hybrid**. The two engines that already
> existed — lexical full-text (`search.ts`, exact keyword/filename) and semantic
> TF-IDF cosine (`semantic.ts`, relevance) — are fused by **Reciprocal Rank
> Fusion** so a note found by either, or modestly by both, ranks well. The fusion
> is a pure, dependency-free, deterministic helper in `@repo/shared`
> (`hybrid.ts` — `reciprocalRankFusion`, `HybridHit`); it combines lists by rank
> position, so the engines' non-comparable scores never need normalizing. A new
> `GET /api/hybrid-search` (and the 19th MCP tool, `hybrid_search`) returns
> `HybridHit[]` (`path`, `name`, `score`, `snippet`, `heading?`, `line`, `tags`,
> `sources: ("text"|"semantic")[]`), reading both engines through the cached
> `VaultIndex` (no extra vault re-read) and preferring the exact lexical line as
> the display snippet. The web Ctrl/Cmd-K switcher gains a **Hybrid** mode
> alongside Text|Semantic. Stays fully local/offline — no model or API key.
> Covered by `apps/api` `hybrid.test.ts` (pure RRF: multi-list reward, weights,
> tie-break determinism, deduped ranks) and `routes/hybridSearch.test.ts`
> (endpoint: keyword+semantic fusion, semantic-only tags, limit, no-stale-after-
> write); the fresh-clone + smoke MCP tests now assert the 19-tool surface and
> exercise `hybrid_search`. This is the first of the gbrain-inspired enhancements
> (see _Next up_).

> **Latest change.** The vault's `[[wikilink]]` **knowledge graph** is now
> visible to the human and traversable by agents — the last human-facing item on
> the roadmap, so the planned roadmap is **complete**. A pure builder in
> `@repo/shared` (`graph.ts` — `buildGraph`) turns the note corpus into
> `GraphData` (`{ nodes: { id, label, tags, unresolved? }, edges: { source,
target, type? } }`) using the same link extraction (`extractWikilinks` +
> `resolveWikilink`) that backs `/api/backlinks`, so the graph and backlinks can
> never disagree. Unresolved link targets become distinct placeholder nodes
> (`unresolved: true`); the typed relation from `[[Target|rel:type]]` rides on
> the edge. `GET /api/graph` (and the 18th MCP tool, `get_graph`) serves it from
> the cached `VaultIndex` (no per-call vault re-read; `.fsbrain/` excluded). In
> the web UI a new **Graph** tab renders a dependency-free, force-directed SVG
> (`apps/web` `KnowledgeGraph`, lazy-loaded; layout in `graphLayout.ts`): click a
> node to open the note, hover to highlight its neighbors, unresolved nodes are
> styled distinctly, with pan/zoom — and it live-refreshes (debounced) off the
> existing `/api/events` stream. Covered by `apps/api` `graph.test.ts` (pure
> builder) + `routes/graph.test.ts` (endpoint, unresolved placeholder, no-stale-
> after-write) and `apps/web` `GraphView.test.tsx` (renders nodes, click opens).

> **Latest change.** The vault is now a first-class **RAG source** for agents.
> An in-memory `VaultIndex` (`apps/api/src/index/vaultIndex.ts`) chunks every
> note and computes the IDF + per-chunk TF-IDF vectors **once**, reusing them
> across queries instead of re-reading the whole vault per request. It
> subscribes to the live-layer `EventBus`, so any create/update/move/delete
> (API or out-of-band) invalidates it and the next query rebuilds from disk —
> reusing the cached content of unchanged notes — and never serves stale results
> after a write. Both `/api/search` and `/api/semantic-search` read through it
> (ranking unchanged). A new **context-bundle** endpoint `GET /api/context`
> (and the `get_context` MCP tool) assembles a token-budgeted bundle: the top
> query-ranked passages (`kind:"match"`) plus — when a `path` focus note is
> given — that note and its backlinks (`kind:"neighbor"`), de-duped and packed
> to a token budget (`ceil(chars/4)`, no tokenizer). Stays fully local/offline;
> the bundle-shaping is pure + tested in `@repo/shared` (`context.ts`) and the
> ranking engine stays swappable for real embeddings behind the same
> `documents → ranked` contract.

> **Latest change.** The web UI now reflects vault changes **the instant they
> happen**. An in-process `EventBus` (`apps/api/src/events/`) receives a
> `VaultEvent` from every mutating handler — published right beside the audit
> write so the stream and the audit log never diverge — and a recursive
> `fs.watch` watcher publishes `source:'watch'` events for out-of-band edits
> (a direct file edit, `git`, another process), ignoring `.fsbrain/` and
> non-`.md` churn and de-duping against API writes. `GET /api/events` streams
> these over Server-Sent Events; the web `useVaultEvents` hook subscribes and
> surgically refreshes the tree, the open file (preserving unsaved drafts —
> showing a non-destructive "changed on disk" prompt instead of clobbering),
> the Activity feed, and the Review badge, with a live/reconnecting indicator.
> The MCP server's embedded API starts the bus + watcher too, so an agent's
> writes surface to a watching human live.

> **Latest change.** The project is now **clone-and-run testable** for an
> agent. `npm run start:agent` launches the self-contained `fsbrain-mcp` —
> when `API_BASE_URL` is unset it starts the storage API in-process on
> `127.0.0.1` (ephemeral port), auto-creates `CONTENT_ROOT` (default
> `~/.fsbrain/vault`), seeds a `welcome.md` on an empty vault, prints a
> one-line readiness banner to stderr, and bundles to a runnable
> `dist/server.js` (npm bin `fsbrain-mcp`). Copy-paste host configs for
> OpenClaw / Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor live in
> [`CONNECT.md`](CONNECT.md). The guarantee is enforced by an automated
> fresh-clone e2e test (`apps/mcp/src/__tests__/freshClone.test.ts`) that
> spawns the bin as a real stdio child against a temp vault, drives it via
> the MCP SDK client, and asserts writes land both on disk and in the audit
> log — runs in `npm test`.
>
> **Heads-up for existing local setups.** The default `CONTENT_ROOT` moved
> from `<cwd>/content` to `~/.fsbrain/vault`. Existing `./content` notes
> aren't deleted, but `npm run dev:api` / `dev:web` without `CONTENT_ROOT`
> set will now read the new path. Set `CONTENT_ROOT=./content` (e.g. in
> `apps/api/.env` or your shell) to keep the old location.

> **Latest change.** The MCP server is now a **single-command launcher**: when

## 1. Vision

A **local-first markdown workspace** that doubles as a **shared brain**:

- **For humans** — navigate like a GitHub repo, edit like a modern docs tool,
  with files stored as plain `.md` (never locked in a database).
- **For agents** — a machine-readable substrate agents can read, search, link,
  and write, where **every agent action stays visible to the human**.

We are closing two gaps in parallel: _Obsidian-for-humans_ (linking, search,
real rendering) and _agent-brain_ (machine API, retrieval, provenance).

apps/mcp (MCP stdio server, 20 tools) — exposes the vault to agents: list/read/
  create/update/patch/search/semantic_search/hybrid_search/get_context/think/
  backlinks/get_graph/recent_activity/move/delete plus read_block,
  get_block_anchors, propose_edit + list_proposals. When
  API_BASE_URL is unset, runs the storage API in-process on 127.0.0.1 (ephemeral
  port), auto-creates CONTENT_ROOT, and seeds a welcome.md on an empty vault, so
  an MCP host (OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor) can spawn it with
  one `node dist/server.js` (npm bin `fsbrain-mcp`). Writes carry X-Actor:
  agent:mcp (override via MCP_ACTOR) and land in the human Activity feed;
  proposals await human approval in the Review tab.
```

Key facts an agent must know:

- **Storage is sandboxed** to `CONTENT_ROOT`. `PathResolver` rejects traversal
  and absolute paths. Do not weaken this.
- **Hidden dotfiles/dirs are excluded** from the tree. The audit log lives in
  `CONTENT_ROOT/.fsbrain/audit.jsonl`.
- **`@repo/shared` is consumed as source** (`main: src/index.ts`); it has no
  test runner — put its unit tests in `apps/api` (node vitest).
- **Optimistic concurrency** exists on writes via `etag` + `lastModified`
  (see `handlePutFile`). Reuse it for any new write path.
- **Provenance:** mutations read the `X-Actor` header (default `human`) and
  append an `AuditEntry`. Keep new write paths recording audit.
- API/MCP relative imports use explicit `.js` extensions (NodeNext). Match that.
  `npm run build` is green across all workspaces — keep it that way.

## 4. Known gaps (the backlog, prioritized)

### For humans (vs Obsidian)

| Gap                                                | Priority | Status |
| -------------------------------------------------- | :------: | :----: |
| `[[wikilinks]]`, backlinks, link graph             |    P0    |   ✅   |
| Real CommonMark/GFM renderer (tables, images, task |    P0    |  ✅†   |
| lists, h3–h6, links, code highlight, math)         |          |        |
| Full-text **content** search + quick switcher      |    P1    |   ✅   |
| Frontmatter / tags / properties                    |    P1    |   ✅   |
| Non-markdown attachments (images, PDFs, canvas)    |    P2    |   ⬜   |
| Command palette, tabs/splits, outline, daily notes |    P2    |   ◑    |
| Version history / trash / Git sync                 |    P2    |   ⬜   |
| Plugin system, themes, mobile, multi-device sync   |    P3    |   ⬜   |

The link graph now has both backlinks and a **visual force-directed graph view**
(the Graph tab + `/api/graph`). ◑ = quick switcher + split done;
palette/outline/daily-notes open. † renderer shipped and lazy-loaded; Mermaid
diagrams are the remaining follow-up (see roadmap).

### For agents (the brain)

| Gap                                                  | Priority | Status |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | :------: | :----: |
| Machine-facing API / **MCP server** over the vault   |    P0    |   ✅   |
| **Provenance**: per-change attribution + audit feed  |    P0    |   ✅   |
| agent-edit review/approval queue                     |    P1    |   ✅   |
| Semantic retrieval (chunking + ranking; embeddings)  |    P1    |  ✅‡   |
| Structured knowledge (note IDs, block anchors `^id`, |    P1    |   ✅   |
| typed link graph)                                    |          |        |
| Section/append/patch writes + idempotency + dry-run  |    P1    |   ✅   |
| Live state (SSE/WebSocket + file watcher)            |    P2    |   ✅   |
| Cached search index (chunks+IDF, write-invalidated)  |    P2    |   ✅   |
| Context-bundle retrieval endpoint (token-budgeted)   |    P2    |   ✅   |
| Auth, per-agent scopes, path-level permissions       |    P2    |   ⬜   |

‡ chunking + TF-IDF cosine ranking shipped (`semantic.ts`, no API key, runs
offline); swapping in real vector embeddings via a provider is the follow-up.
Structured knowledge: Obsidian-style block anchors (`^id`), a frontmatter
`id:` for stable note identity (opt-in), and typed wikilinks
`[[Target|rel:type]]` all shipped together; the visual link graph view has now
shipped too (Graph tab + `GET /api/graph`).

## 5. Roadmap (sequenced slices)

Each slice is a vertical, demoable increment. Build in order — each unlocks the
next.

1. **Slice 1 — Links & metadata foundation.** ✅ Done.
   `markdown.ts` (frontmatter, `#tags`, `[[wikilink]]` parse + resolve),
   `GET /api/backlinks`, clickable wikilinks, backlinks panel.
2. **Slice 3 — Full-text + tag search.** ✅ Done.
   `GET /api/search` (text + tag), `search.ts` helper, Ctrl/Cmd-K `SearchDialog`
   (prefix `#` for tag search).
3. **Slice 4 — MCP server.** ✅ Done.
   `apps/mcp` stdio server exposing the vault as 16 tools. Self-contained: when
   `API_BASE_URL` is unset it starts the storage API in-process on
   `127.0.0.1` (ephemeral port), auto-creates `CONTENT_ROOT`
   (default `~/.fsbrain/vault`), and seeds a `welcome.md` on first run.
   Bundled to a single-file bin via esbuild (`fsbrain-mcp` →
   `apps/mcp/dist/server.js`) so an MCP host can spawn it with one
   `node dist/server.js`. Writes carry `X-Actor: agent:mcp` (override via
   `MCP_ACTOR`) and flow through the audit trail. Copy-paste host configs
   for OpenClaw / Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor:
   [`CONNECT.md`](CONNECT.md). The clone-and-run guarantee is enforced by
   `apps/mcp/src/__tests__/freshClone.test.ts`, which spawns the bin as a
   real stdio child against a temp vault and asserts writes land on disk
   and in the audit log — runs in `npm test`.
4. **Slice 6a — Provenance.** ✅ Done.
   `X-Actor` attribution, append-only `AuditLog` (`.fsbrain/audit.jsonl`),
   `GET /api/audit`, and the human-facing **Activity** tab.
5. **Slice 2 — Real renderer.** ✅ Done.
   `MarkdownPreviewPane` uses `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` (tables, task
   lists, strikethrough, autolinks, h3–h6), `remark-math` + `rehype-katex`
   (math), and highlight.js for fenced code (keeping the copy button). The
   `remarkWikilinks` plugin preserves `[[wikilinks]]`; frontmatter is stripped
   and tags render as chips. The pane is lazy-loaded (`React.lazy`), so the main
   bundle stays ~63 kB gzip and the renderer (~186 kB gzip) loads on demand.
6. **Slice 5 — Semantic search.** ✅ Done (local).
   `semantic.ts` chunks notes and ranks them by TF-IDF cosine similarity;
   `GET /api/semantic-search`, a Text|Semantic toggle in `SearchDialog`, and a
   `semantic_search` MCP tool. Runs offline, no API key. A real embedding
   provider can replace the ranking engine without changing callers.
7. **Slice 6b — Agent-edit review queue.** ✅ Done.
   Agents `propose_edit` (`POST /api/proposals`) create/update/delete edits;
   `ProposalStore` keeps them in `.fsbrain/proposals/`. A human reviews the diff
   in the **Review** tab and approves (applied + audited as the proposer) or
   rejects. Resolution is human-only. Closes the provenance trust loop.
8. **Slice 7 — Granular agent writes.** ✅ Done.
   `PATCH /api/file` (and the `patch_note` MCP tool) apply `append`,
   `prepend`, or `replace_section` ops without rewriting the whole note.
   Pure transforms live in `@repo/shared` (`patch.ts`). The endpoint reuses
   the `etag` optimistic-concurrency contract, accepts an `idempotencyKey`
   so a retried patch is a no-op (in-memory LRU cache; resets on API
   restart), supports `dryRun` to preview without writing or auditing, and
   records audit attribution via `X-Actor`.
9. **Slice 8 — Structured knowledge.** ✅ Done.
   Obsidian-style **block anchors** (`^id`) give agents stable addresses
   inside a note. Pure helpers live in `@repo/shared` (`blocks.ts`):
   `extractBlockAnchors`, `findBlock` (paragraph / list-item /
   heading-section), `upsertBlockAnchor`. `GET /api/block` returns a block
   - surrounding context; `GET /api/block-anchors` lists every anchor.
     `PATCH /api/file` gains a `replace_block` op (anchor re-attached so the
     block stays addressable) and an `ensure_id` op (adds frontmatter `id:`
     if missing — idempotent). `/api/file` and the patch endpoint accept
     `id=` as an alternative to `path=`. Wikilink parsing recognizes
     `[[Target|rel:supports]]` and `/api/backlinks` surfaces the relation
     (`type`). The MCP server adds `read_block` and `get_block_anchors`, and
     `patch_note` exposes `replace_block` / `ensure_id`. The preview
     unobtrusively renders trailing `^id` markers; everything else stays the
     same. Provenance is preserved — block writes audit under the requesting
     actor like any other PATCH.

### Prioritization

This is a **local, single-user tool optimized for agent interaction on the
owner's machine** — not a multi-user / externally-exposed service. So the
priorities are **agent depth** plus a **visual graph** for the human. Multi-user
concerns (authn/z, per-agent scopes, rate limiting), CI, attachments, editor
polish, mobile, and multi-device sync are **explicitly deprioritized** for now.

10. **Slice 9 — Live layer.** ✅ Done.
    An in-process `EventBus` (`apps/api/src/events/eventBus.ts`) receives a
    `VaultEvent` (`@repo/shared`) from every mutating handler, published beside
    the audit write so the live stream and the audit log never diverge. A
    recursive `fs.watch` watcher (`watcher.ts`, ~150ms debounce) publishes
    `source:'watch'` events for out-of-band edits, ignoring `.fsbrain/` and
    non-`.md` churn and de-duping against API writes within a short window.
    `GET /api/events` (`sse.ts`) streams events over SSE with heartbeats and
    disconnect cleanup. The web `useVaultEvents` hook subscribes via
    `EventSource`, auto-reconnects, and surgically refreshes the tree, the open
    file (preserving unsaved drafts — a "changed on disk" prompt rather than a
    clobber), the Activity feed, and the Review badge; a live/reconnecting
    indicator sits in the layout. The MCP server's embedded API starts the bus
    - watcher too. Covered by `apps/api/src/routes/events.test.ts` (SSE +
      watcher + `.fsbrain` exclusion) and
      `apps/web/src/hooks/__tests__/useVaultEvents.test.ts`.

11. **Slice 10 — RAG: cached index + context bundles.** ✅ Done.
    An in-memory `VaultIndex` (`apps/api/src/index/vaultIndex.ts`) chunks every
    note and computes the IDF + per-chunk TF-IDF vectors once (shared
    `buildSemanticIndex` / `queryRankedChunks` in `semantic.ts`), reusing them
    across queries. It subscribes to the live-layer `EventBus`, so any
    create/update/move/delete (API or watcher) invalidates it; the next query
    lazily rebuilds from disk, reusing the cached content of unchanged notes, and
    never serves stale results after a write. Both `/api/search` and
    `/api/semantic-search` read through it; ranking is unchanged (verified by the
    pre-existing `semantic.test.ts` / `searchAudit.test.ts`). `GET /api/context`
    (and the `get_context` MCP tool, 17th tool) assembles a token-budgeted
    bundle — top query-ranked passages (`kind:"match"`) plus, for a focus
    `path`, that note + its backlinks (`kind:"neighbor"`) — de-duped and packed
    within the budget (`ceil(chars/4)`, no tokenizer dep). The shaping helpers
    are pure + tested in `@repo/shared` (`context.ts`); covered by
    `apps/api/src/__tests__/context.test.ts` (packing/de-dupe/truncation) and
    `apps/api/src/routes/context.test.ts` (relevance, 422, no-stale-after-write).
    Fully local/offline; the ranking engine stays swappable for real embeddings.

12. **Slice 11 — Visual knowledge graph.** ✅ Done. **Completes the planned
    roadmap.** A pure `buildGraph` (`@repo/shared` `graph.ts`) turns the note
    corpus into `GraphData` (`{ nodes: { id, label, tags, unresolved? }, edges:
{ source, target, type? } }`) using the same `extractWikilinks` +
    `resolveWikilink` as `/api/backlinks`. Unresolved link targets become
    distinct placeholder nodes (`unresolved: true`); a typed `[[Target|rel:type]]`
    relation rides on the edge; self-links and duplicate edges are dropped.
    `GET /api/graph` (and the `get_graph` MCP tool, 18th tool) serves it from the
    cached `VaultIndex` — no per-call vault re-read, `.fsbrain/` excluded,
    read-only (no `VaultEvent`). The web **Graph** tab renders a dependency-free,
    force-directed SVG (`apps/web` `KnowledgeGraph`, lazy-loaded; deterministic
    Fruchterman–Reingold layout in `graphLayout.ts`): click a node to open the
    note, hover to highlight a node + its neighbors, unresolved nodes styled with
    the `wikilink--unresolved` palette, optional tag colouring, pan/zoom — and it
    live-refreshes (debounced) off the existing `/api/events` stream. Covered by
    `apps/api` `graph.test.ts` (builder) + `routes/graph.test.ts` (endpoint,
    unresolved placeholder, no-stale-after-write) and `apps/web`
    `GraphView.test.tsx` (renders nodes from `/api/graph`, click opens a note).

### Next up (open, in priority order)

The planned roadmap is complete. The remaining items are optional enhancements,
not part of the original plan:

13. **Real embeddings** (the remaining half of RAG). Swap the TF-IDF ranker for
    vector embeddings (remote `/v1/embeddings` or on-device) behind the existing
    `documents → ranked` seam — `buildSemanticIndex` / `queryRankedChunks` and
    the `VaultIndex` cache already isolate callers from the engine, and the
    context-bundle endpoint consumes ranked chunks regardless of how they were
    scored. Persist the index across restarts as a follow-on.
14. **Mermaid diagrams** — render fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks in the preview
    (the last renderer follow-up; the wikilink graph view above is done).

#### Brain ideas (inspired by gbrain)

A backlog of enhancements adapted from [gbrain](https://github.com/garrytan/gbrain),
an AI-agent memory system, but cut to fit this repo's design constraints
(**local-first, offline, no API key, pure + deterministic helpers in
`@repo/shared`, every agent write audited**). Listed in build order; each plugs
into infrastructure we already have rather than adding a new subsystem.

15. **Hybrid retrieval (RRF).** ✅ **Done.** Fuse the existing lexical
    (`search.ts`) and semantic (`semantic.ts`) rankings with Reciprocal Rank
    Fusion so neither exact keyword hits nor conceptually-related passages are
    missed. Pure fusion helper in `@repo/shared` (`hybrid.ts` —
    `reciprocalRankFusion`, `HybridHit`); `GET /api/hybrid-search` + the
    `hybrid_search` MCP tool + a **Hybrid** mode in the Ctrl/Cmd-K switcher. Both
    engines read through the cached `VaultIndex`. Tests: `apps/api`
    `__tests__/hybrid.test.ts` (pure RRF) and `routes/hybridSearch.test.ts`
    (endpoint). _gbrain parallel: its biggest measured win came from fusing
    vector + keyword + RRF rather than vector-only retrieval._
16. **`think` — synthesized, cited answers + gap analysis.** ✅ **Done.** Builds
    on hybrid retrieval + the token-budgeted context bundle to return a **cited
    answer kit**: numbered citations (`[1]`, `[2]`…) mapped to each source passage
    (path + heading + `^block` anchor), the passages, and a deterministic,
    **offline gap analysis** (`weakCoverage` + `uncoveredTerms` — "what the vault
    doesn't yet cover"), all computed with **no model**. Pure helper in
    `@repo/shared` (`think.ts` — `assembleAnswerKit`); `GET /api/think` + the
    `think` MCP tool. Offline by default — the calling agent is the LLM and
    composes the final answer from the kit; a server-side `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
    plus `?synthesize=1` optionally adds a synthesized prose `answer`. Tests:
    `apps/api` `__tests__/think.test.ts` (pure) + `routes/think.test.ts`
    (endpoint). _gbrain parallel: `gbrain think` — "search gives raw pages, the
    brain gives the answer," with built-in gap analysis._
17. **Dream-cycle maintenance → proposals.** A scheduled scan that flags
    near-duplicate notes, broken wikilinks, orphans, and contradictory
    statements, then files each as a **proposal** a human approves in the Review
    tab — reusing the `ProposalStore` + `EventBus` we already ship. _gbrain
    parallel: its 24/7 "dream cycle" that dedupes, fixes citations, and finds
    contradictions overnight._
18. **Self-wiring typed graph edges.** Derive typed edges from frontmatter
    (e.g. `related:`, `type:`) so the knowledge graph wires itself without manual
    `[[Target|rel:type]]` discipline. _gbrain parallel: typed edges
    (`works_at`, `attended`) auto-extracted on write, zero LLM calls._
19. **Schema packs / typed page types.** Canonical frontmatter `type:` values
    (person, meeting, idea…) with allowed relationships — powers graph node
    colouring, validation, and retrieval boosting. _gbrain parallel:
    `gbrain-base-v2` with 15 canonical types._
20. **Retrieval eval harness.** A small fixture of `query → expected-note`
    pairs so ranking changes can't silently regress recall. _gbrain parallel:
    its LongMemEval / NamedThingBench regression suite._

Deferred (not a priority for the local/agent focus): authn/z + per-agent scopes,
CI pipeline, non-markdown attachments, editor ergonomics (palette/outline/daily
notes/WYSIWYG), version history/Git sync, plugins/themes/mobile/sync. Proposal
follow-ups also deferred: settled-proposal retention/pruning, a computed
line-level diff in the Review UI, and closing the no-`baseEtag` update TOCTOU.

The vault is now natively an agent's brain _and_ auditable by the human, and the
human can finally _see_ how it all connects via the graph — completing the
planned roadmap. The optional items above deepen it further.
