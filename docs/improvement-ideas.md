# Improvement ideas — self-improvement loops

The repo already has every piece a self-improvement loop needs — provenance,
a human-gated proposal queue, retrieval with gap analysis, and an offline
maintenance scan. What's missing is that nothing _reads the signal back_.
These ideas close those loops, in rough order of leverage.

---

## 1. Skill notes — procedural memory the agent grows itself

✅ **Done** — backlog item #21 in
[`implementation.md`](implementation.md). The vault stores **declarative**
knowledge (facts, notes); this added a convention for **procedural**
knowledge: notes with `type: skill` frontmatter (optional `name:` /
`description:`) containing a goal, steps, and gotchas.

- Shipped as `@repo/shared` `skills.ts` (`parseSkill`, `listSkills`),
  `GET /api/skills?q=...`, and the `list_skills` MCP tool (22nd).
- Reading a skill is a plain `read_note`; `get_skill` was dropped as
  redundant with it — one new read surface is enough.
- The `list_skills` tool description nudges the agent to check for a skill
  before a non-trivial task and to `propose_edit` a new/updated skill after
  completing one — "write down what worked." The human approves it in the
  Review tab like any proposal.

Over time the agent distills its own successful workflows into reusable,
human-audited playbooks. Pairs naturally with backlog #19 (schema packs) —
`skill` becomes one of the canonical types.

## 2. Learn from the review queue

Proposals record approve/reject outcomes, but nothing ever reads that signal.
Mine it:

- Track approval rates per proposal category (broken-link stubs, duplicate
  cross-links, future skill notes).
- Auto-tune the dream cycle: if duplicate-detection proposals keep getting
  rejected, raise the cosine-similarity threshold; if they're always
  approved, get more aggressive.

The proposal store is a labeled training set we already collect and discard.
A deterministic, offline tuner fits the repo's "no LLM, pure helpers"
constraint.

## 3. Question log → gap-driven growth

✅ **Done** — backlog item #22 in
[`implementation.md`](implementation.md). `think` used to compute
`uncoveredTerms` and `weakCoverage` per query, then throw them away; now
every `think` query is persisted with its gap signal (and `X-Actor`
attribution) to `.fsbrain/questions.jsonl`, beside the audit log.

- Shipped as a `QuestionLog` store (mirrors `AuditLog`), pure
  `findKnowledgeGaps` in `@repo/shared` `questions.ts`,
  `GET /api/questions?limit&minCount`, and the `recent_questions` MCP tool
  (23rd) returning `{ entries, gaps }`.
- A **recurring gap** is a term left uncovered by ≥ `minCount` questions
  (default 2; asking the same thing twice counts — repetition is demand).
  The tool description nudges the agent to `propose_edit` a note filling a
  recurring gap, closing the loop with human review.
- Deferred from v1: surfacing gaps as maintenance findings in the web Review
  tab (needs a new `MaintenanceFinding` kind + UI work; the agent-facing
  loop above already works without it).

The vault learns what knowledge it's missing from actual usage rather than
static analysis.

## 4. Implicit relevance feedback for ranking

When an agent runs `hybrid_search` and then `read_note`s result #3 and cites
it via `think`, that's a relevance label. Correlate search→read/cite
sequences from the audit log and use them two ways:

- a small learned per-note ranking prior;
- auto-generated fixtures for the **retrieval eval harness** (backlog #20).

The eval harness is the prerequisite for _any_ self-tuning — the system must
have a regression measure before it's allowed to adjust itself.

## 5. Freshness / decay scoring

Track last-modified vs. how often a note is retrieved. "Stale but
load-bearing" notes (old, heavily cited) are the highest-risk content —
surface them as a maintenance finding ("review this?"). Cheap, deterministic,
and makes the dream cycle feel genuinely alive.

## Quick wins that unlock the above

- **CI pipeline.** ✅ Done — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
  `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm run format` on every
  PR and push to `main`, so the eval harness and the fresh-clone MCP e2e
  gate every change.
- **Git-backed version history for the vault.** Auto-commit on writes (or
  snapshot per proposal approval) gives undo for agent writes — a trust
  unlock that makes the loops above safe to run more autonomously.
- **Backlog #18–19** (self-wiring typed edges, schema packs) pair naturally
  with skill notes.
- **Real embeddings (#13)** behind the existing seam — with the eval harness
  (#20) in place first, so the swap is _proven_ to improve recall rather than
  assumed.

## Suggested sequence

**CI → eval harness (#20) → skill notes (#1) → question log (#3) →
review-queue tuning (#2).** Every self-improvement mechanism lands on top of
a safety net, and each reuses the proposal/audit/think plumbing — no new
subsystems. _CI, the eval harness, skill notes (#1), and the question log
(#3) have shipped; review-queue tuning (#2) is next._
